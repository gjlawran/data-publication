# BEFORE YOU START 

Do you have a dataset that you'd like to publish through the [_DataBC Program_](https://data.gov.bc.ca/)?
Before your data is published, we will need to gather some information from you. This page will guide you through that process.

# Audience

This page is relevant to anyone considering making their data available through any of the DataBC Program's access channels. 

# Purpose

The purpose of this page is to help the [DataBC Data Architecture](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) team learn about your requirements and to determine whether the DataBC Program can meet them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## INTRODUCTION

The DataBC Program makes data available through combinations of several different channels:

+ the [_BC Geographic Warehouse_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=18B291A12B4F42EA98169892F4B46D61)
+ the [_BC Data Catalogue_](https://catalogue.data.goc.bc.ca)
+ [_iMapBC_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=C52F8C3BFE8C4110A63171337F363F43)
+ [_Web Map Services (WMS) and Feature Services (WFS)_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=95D78D544B244F34B89223EF069DF74E)
+ [_BC Map Hub_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=DE0602BB42664AA28C9F059D45CC1CC2)
+ [_Data Download_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B19E16070B824DB481F49CEE3B9AF1F8) through the BC Data Catalogue, iMapBC and (___coming soon___) the Order Fulfiller Interface (OFI) Application Programming Interface (API)

In addition, other agencies provide mechanisms for accessing DataBC data:

+ the Geographic Terminal Servers (GTS - available through [dts.gov.bc.ca](https://dts.gov.bc.ca))
+ [_BCData R package_](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata)

There are four options for where data gets stored in the DataBC Program, each with its own benefits and drawbacks:

1. In the BC Geographic Warehouse:
   + different levels of access control are offered (e.g., public, IDIR, named-user)
   + spatial data can be viewed in iMapBC and ArcGIS products
   + spatial data can be viewed in BC MapHub, web map, and web feature services (WMS/WFS)
   + spatial data can be clipped to a specific area or region and downloaded
   + non-spatial data can be downloaded
   + The BC Data Catalogue contains a record describing the dataset. 

2. In the BC Data Catalogue, attached to the BC Data Catalogue metadata record describing the dataset:
   + datasets can be downloaded in their entirety or provided via API
   + csv files can be viewed in spreadsheet mode
   + csv files with point data spatial coordinates can be viewed on a map
   + only publically accessible data 
   + files are limited in size to 150 MB.   

3. On [_pub.data.gov.bc.ca_](https://pub.data.gov.bc.ca)
   + datasets can be downloaded in their entirety only
   + only publically accessible data 
   + larger files are accommodated
   + The BC Data Catalogue contains a record describing the dataset. 

4. On an external website
   + datasets can be downloaded in their entirety only
   + there are limited security options (public only)
   + larger files are accommodated
   + The BC Data Catalogue contains a record describing the dataset.

## QUESTIONS

In order to help us determine how your data best fits into these options and services, please take a moment to answer the following questions, and send your responses, or questions/concerns to <DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca>.

### Questions about the Data

+ Provide a short description of the dataset(s).
+ Does the data already exist in the DataBC Program? (e.g., the BC Geographic Warehouse, the BC Data Catalogue, etc.)
   + If these are replacement dataset(s), what are the dataset(s) to retire?
+ Does this data belong with any other groupings of data in the BC Geographic Warehouse?
+ Is the data provincial in extent? This doesn't mean that the dataset necessarily contains data for all parts of the province.  It just means that if there were data for some other part of the province then it would be included in the dataset.
   + If not provincial in extent now, is there an intent to make the dataset provincial in extent in the future?

#### Dataset Complexity

+ How many datasets (please indicate if point, line, polygon, or non-spatial) and approximately how many attribute field columns are there in each dataset? 
+ What is the size of each dataset (approx. how many features/records?)
+ What is its intended growth (e.g., it will grow 10% over the next year and 1% after?)
+ How frequently is the data to be updated? (nightly, weekly, monthly, annually, ad-hoc)
+ What is the file format and where is the source data currently stored? 
   + Is it in database or a file store?

[RETURN TO TOP][1]

-----------------------------------------

### Custodianship Considerations

+ Has this dataset been created by the Province of British Columbia?
   + If no, is your business area the authorized [_Data Steward_](a_guide_for_data_custodians_and_data_managers.md#the-data-steward)? 
      + For example, BCStats acts as the authorized _Data Steward_ for data collected and disseminated by Statistics Canada.
+ Do you have Director level approval? 
   + Your Director will be the _Data Custodian_, and ultimately accountable for the dataset.
   + Refer to [_What is a Data Custodian_](a_guide_for_data_custodians_and_data_managers.md#what-is-a-data-custodian) for further details.
+ Is there a program (staff and resources) in place to ensure this data kept up-to-date? Are there identified staff managing the data, i.e., Data Manager?
   + Refer to [_What it means to be a Data Manager_](a_guide_for_data_custodians_and_data_managers.md#what-it-means-to-be-a-data-manager) for further details.

-----------------------------------------

### Relationship to Legislation

+ Is this dataset associated with legislation or policy? In other words, is the dataset:
   + required by legislation or policy? (e.g., to provide public access)
   + necessary to assist staff in carrying out tasks required by legislation or policy?

[RETURN TO TOP][1]

-----------------------------------------

### Audience Considerations

+ Who is the intended audience? Public, BC Government, People with a Business BCeID, Individual specific people. 
   + If the audience is the public, is the intention to make the data under the [_BC Open Government Licence_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61)?  
+ Are there existing or new applications that will use this data?    
+ What tools (visualize or otherwise) will be used to access the data?
   + [_DataBC Products & Services_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A3358A6053464AE484A105D6E877833F)

### Dataset Readiness

+ What are the anticipated publication timelines for your data? 
+ Is there a date when this dataset needs to be available through the DataBC Program?
+ Are there any other time constraints we should be aware of? 
   + For example, is the data tied to the release of a computer systems application or a Minister's announcement? 
+ Is the data for the dataset already available?  
+ Do you have a data modelling vendor in place?
+ Have you identified who will create and maintain the metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue?
+ Have you identified GIS staff who will produce the layerfiles (.lyr) via ArcMap for the spatial dataset(s) and QA/QC both the data and the visualizations?

-----------------------------------------

### Financial Obligations

DataBC operates on a cost-recovery basis, so there _may_ be a charge to your branch for making your data available through the DataBC program. 

This one-time charge covers not only the initial loading of the dataset, but also the ongoing maintenance and refreshing of the data.

Whether or not there is a charge depends on how the data is to be made available and on the size of the potential audience.  

These are some rough guidelines:
+ Depending on DataBC resources, datasets that are considered foundational (of use to many different business areas) might be loaded at no charge.
+ Data to be made available solely within the BC Data Catalogue (i.e., not stored in the BC Geographic Warehouse) will be loaded at no charge. 

If there is a charge it will generally be between $1500 and $7000, depending on:

+ the number of datasets
+ the complexity (number of columns) of the datasets
+ the security requirements (e.g., public vs access by only named individuals)
+ the access channels to be used (e.g., iMapBC, data download, etc.)

In certain circumstances there may be additional charges for the following:

+ the dataset is extremely large (several million rows or larger)
+ the load requires extensive manipulation and transformation of the input data
+ we need to be heavily involved in operational planning (planning preparation of the data set)  
+ the data source is nonstandard
   + Standard sources are:
      + Oracle operational BC Government databases, 
	  + csv files, 
	  + shape files, 
	  + file geodatabases, 
	  + text files, 
	  + rest APIs.

The amount of the charge will be discussed at the [_Discovery Whiteboard_](bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#discovery-whiteboard), held at the beginning of the publication process.

Changes to the structure of the dataset after the initial load may incur additional charges. Examples of changes are addition and removal of columns, changes in column names, etc. If you envision many changes over time or the addition of new datasets or continuing support in preparing data you may wish to enter into a support agreement with DataBC, which can also be discussed at the [_Discovery Whiteboard_](bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#discovery-whiteboard).
